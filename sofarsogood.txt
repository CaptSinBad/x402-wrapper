Short answer: you’re building a seller-facing payment gateway + dashboard that lets merchants register paid endpoints (resources), accept x402-style payments (Coinbase x402 / EIP-3009-style signed authorizations) from buyers, verify and settle those payments with a facilitator, and view/operate settlements and analytics — plus a small buyer SDK to simplify the flow.

Here’s a compact description of the end product, how it works, and what “done” looks like.

## Product summary (one-liner)
A lightweight payment orchestration platform and seller dashboard that turns any HTTP resource into a paid resource using x402-compatible signed payments, provides onboarding and endpoint management for sellers, runs verification/settlement through a facilitator, and gives sellers settlement history and analytics. Includes a buyer SDK (payAndFetch) and worker to reconcile settlement processing.

## Who it’s for
- Sellers/merchants who want to gate access to an HTTP resource (API, file, page) and collect crypto-based payments via x402-compatible facilitators.
- Developers who want an SDK and simple REST/webhook integration to add paywalls to apps.
- Platform operators who need a dashboard to manage endpoints, settlements and run reconciliation.

## Core features (what users actually get)
- Seller onboarding: connect wallet (Privy), register endpoints with price/asset/facilitator settings.
- Endpoint management: list, edit, enable/disable paid endpoints.
- Buyer SDK & demo client: `payAndFetch` + `createSignedPaymentHeader` to detect 402, sign with a wallet, and retry request with X-PAYMENT header.
- Server side:
  - `POST /api/create_payment_session` — creates paymentRequirements and a tracking `payment_attempt`.
  - Payment middleware (`/api/paid/resource`) — accept X-PAYMENT header and delegate verification to facilitator.
  - `POST /api/facilitator/webhook` — receive facilitator callbacks (verify/settle) and reconcile.
- Background worker: process queued settlements, call facilitator `/settle`, update DB.
- Dashboard & analytics: settlement list, logs, simple metrics (revenue, processed, pending).
- Docs & SDK: quickstart for adding payment button to Shopify/WooCommerce/Primer and a small JS SDK for buyers.

## High-level flow (buyer -> seller)
1. Buyer requests a protected resource, server responds 402 with x402 `paymentRequirements`.
2. Buyer client (SDK) signs a payment intent using wallet (Privy/MetaMask/Coinbase Wallet) — producing a PaymentPayload.
3. Client encodes `{ paymentPayload, paymentRequirements }` into `X-PAYMENT` header and retries the resource.
4. Server middleware decodes header and calls facilitator `/verify` with payload.
5. If verify succeeds, middleware returns the protected resource; server logs attempt and optionally enqueues settlement.
6. Worker picks up queued settlements, calls facilitator `/settle`, updates DB to `confirmed` and stores txHash.

## Tech stack (what it uses today)
- Frontend: Next.js (app + pages), React, Privy for wallet auth.
- Backend: Node/Next API routes, optional Supabase or Postgres (`apps/lib/dbClient` supports both).
- DB: Postgres (migrations in migrations).
- Worker: Node script settlementWorker.js.
- Buyer SDK: payAndFetch.ts and client (thin re-export).
- Facilitator integration: `core/facilitator/*` and the `facilitators` npm package (installed via pnpm --ignore-scripts due to upstream packaging).
- Tests: Vitest with integration/unit tests.

## Data model (conceptual)
- sellers (id, name, owner_email, created_at)
- seller_endpoints (id, seller_wallet, endpoint_url, price, currency, network, scheme, facilitator_url, metadata)
- payment_attempts (id, seller_endpoint_id, payment_payload, verifier_response, status)
- settlements (id, payment_attempt_id, facilitator_request/response, status, tx_hash, attempts)
- payment_logs (audit/error logs)
- facilitators (configured facilitator entries)

## Public API contract (key endpoints)
- POST /api/create_payment_session
  - Input: { endpoint_id | endpoint_url, client_ip? }
  - Output: { paymentRequirements, paymentAttempt }
  - Purpose: server-made x402 paymentRequirements (audit/tracking).
- POST protected resource (client uses X-PAYMENT header)
  - Header: X-PAYMENT = base64(JSON({ paymentPayload, paymentRequirements }))
  - Server: decodes, calls facilitator verify, returns resource on success.
- POST /api/facilitator/webhook
  - Accepts verify/settle callbacks. Updates attempts/settlements and logs.

(These are already scaffolded in the repo and can be extended as required.)

## Success criteria / MVP definition
MVP = minimal product you can operate for real sellers:
- Seller can connect wallet, register an endpoint with price and facilitator URL.
- Buyer SDK can perform the flow against a staging facilitator endpoint and successfully receive protected content after payment (demo via fake-mode and then live facilitator).
- Backend persists payment attempts and settlements; worker processes settlements to `confirmed` state.
- Webhooks update records reliably and safely.
- CI runs migrations and tests; secrets are managed in CI/secret store (no plaintext in repo).

## Security & compliance (must-haves)
- Never commit secret keys to repo (already untracked .env.local; rotate any leaked secrets).
- Webhook authentication: validate signatures (HMAC) or a shared secret header.
- Restrict facilitator credentials securely in CI/secret manager.
- Input validation on all endpoints (Zod validators already used).
- Rate-limits / abuse protections for public endpoints.

## Deployment / operations
- Deployable as a Next.js app + worker (containerize). Use Postgres in staging/production.
- CI: run migrations, env-validate, tests; deploy to staging with manual approval to production.
- Monitoring: basic health check `/healthz`, logs, Sentry for errors, metrics for settlement throughput.

## Risks & edge cases
- Facilitator incompatibility (different facilitator implementations may not echo attempt IDs) — need heuristics (match by txHash/payer).
- SDK signing differences across wallets (EIP-712 vs signer behavior) — test widely.
- The `facilitators` npm package upstream packaging required care (postinstall build); we worked around that. Consider vendoring or pinning a built artifact.
- Settlement failure/retries must be carefully rate-limited and idempotent.

## Roadmap / recommended next steps (short list)
1. Fix the remaining test instability and add a deterministic integration test for sign->verify (mock facilitator & wallet).
2. Add webhook HMAC verification and document required CI secret name.
3. Wire UI forms (RegisterEndpointForm) to the persisted endpoints (already largely done).
4. Add health check & metrics.
5. Harden CI: add secret-scan step, env validator, run migrations on CI.
6. Prepare staging deploy + smoke tests, then a small pilot with a test facilitator.

## What “done” looks like (operational)
- Sellers can sign-up and create endpoints, buyers can pay and access resources.
- All payments are recorded, settlements processed automatically, and the dashboard shows clear settlement state and basic analytics.
- Tests, CI, and deployment pipeline validate and push code safely; secrets handled by secret manager; runbook for rotation and incident response.

If you want I can:
- Draft a short product spec / landing page copy summarizing the product for stakeholders.
- Produce the minimal runbook and the list of exact environment variables + CI secret names to go to staging.
- Finish the integration test and webhook HMAC implementation next.

Which one of these would you like me to do first?
