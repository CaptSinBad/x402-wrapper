node scripts/run-migrations.jse summary



xsynesis is being built as a Stripe-like payments platform using Coinbase x402 (CDP) as the facilitator layer. Our aim is to provide sellers with first-class primitives similar to Stripe Connect: payment links, POS/QR flows, payouts/offramp, and simple onboarding — all powered by x402 settlement rails where appropriate.

The codebase already contains the core backend primitives (reservations, payment attempts, settlements queue, worker, payouts/offramp and a buyer SDK). The Coinbase x402 CDP integration (see `core/facilitator`) is the primary facilitator adapter for settlement flows. Recent work implemented a public link resolver and a basic pay flow, standardized API surfaces to pages-based endpoints, and added an offramp (payouts) feature and a dev-settle simulator. Remaining work focuses on admin UX (payment links management), RBAC, idempotency, worker hardening, and CI packaging.

Quick status: dev-settle ✓, public link resolver & pay flow ✓, payment-links schema + admin CRUD ✓, payouts/offramp ✓, RBAC/Privy ✓, idempotency ✓, reservation reaper ✗, CI pnpm triage ✗.

## What we have (high level)

- Core primitives: reservations, payment_attempts, settlements queue, settlement worker, and the atomic helper `confirmReservationAndCreateSale` (exists in `apps/lib/dbClient.ts`). Both Postgres and Supabase code paths are implemented; Postgres path uses transactions for atomicity.
- Buyer SDK: EIP-712 signing helper and pay-and-fetch utilities in `sdk/client` and `sdk/*` examples (x402 client wrappers like `x402-fetch`/`x402-axios` are expected to work with the resolver).
- Facilitator/settlement wiring: the worker calls a configured `FACILITATOR_URL` (`/settle` endpoint). The repo is ready to use Coinbase CDP via `@coinbase/x402` (examples and helper imports exist), but xsynesis currently posts to a configurable facilitator URL — Option B will wire `@coinbase/x402` directly into verify/settle helpers and the worker when CDP env vars are present.
- Payment links: schema present (`db/migrations/006_payment_links.sql`), helpers in `apps/lib/dbClient.ts` (`createPaymentLink`, `getPaymentLinkByToken`, `listPaymentLinksBySeller`, `getPaymentLinkById`, `updatePaymentLink`, `expirePaymentLink`), admin create API (`apps/dashboard/pages/api/payment_links/create.ts`), list/update/expire endpoints (`apps/dashboard/pages/api/payment_links/list.ts`, `update.ts`, `expire.ts`), dashboard UI component (`PaymentLinksManager.tsx`), and a public resolver API (`apps/dashboard/pages/api/link/[token].ts`) plus client page (`app/link/[token]/page.tsx`). Persistent idempotency via `idempotency_keys` table (`db/migrations/008_idempotency_keys.sql`) for replay protection on link POSTs.
- Dev-settle simulator: dev-only flows and controls exist; the public UI currently prompts using dev-settle to complete a sale in development.
- Offramp / payouts: migration (`db/migrations/007_payouts.sql`), DB helpers (`createPayout`, `listPayouts` in `apps/lib/dbClient.ts`), pages API and a basic dashboard panel implemented.
- API surface: dashboard/admin endpoints standardized to Next.js pages APIs and protected wiring exists (`apps/lib/requireSellerAuth.ts`, `apps/lib/verifyPrivySession.ts`). All seller-scoped admin endpoints are now wrapped with `requireSellerAuth` and include authorization checks (seller ownership validation).

## Key files (where to look)

- `apps/lib/dbClient.ts` — canonical DB helpers (Postgres + Supabase dual-path). Contains create/get helpers for payment_links, payment_attempts, settlements, payouts, and reservation helpers including `confirmReservationAndCreateSale`.
- `apps/dashboard/pages/api/link/[token].ts` — public resolver (GET) and POST that creates a payment_attempt (Idempotency not yet persisted).
- `app/link/[token]/page.tsx` — public client page resolving a link and allowing a buyer to create a payment attempt.
- `apps/dashboard/pages/api/payment_links/create.ts` — admin create endpoint for links (needs RBAC wrapping).
- `db/migrations/006_payment_links.sql` — payment_links schema (present).
- `db/migrations/007_payouts.sql` — payouts schema (present).
- `scripts/settlementWorker.js` — settlement worker logic (claim semantics need hardening).

## What was done recently

- **Task 7 (RBAC / Privy server-side gating):** Completed systemwide RBAC enforcement for admin endpoints.
  - Audited all admin endpoints and identified 10 seller-scoped endpoints.
  - Fixed `admin/settlements` endpoint to use `requireSellerAuth` (was using `requireAuth`).
  - All seller-scoped admin endpoints now protected:
    - Payment links: `list`, `update`, `expire` with seller ownership validation
    - Activation codes: `generate` with endpoint ownership validation
    - Payouts: `list`, `create`, `update` with seller ownership validation
    - Sales: `list` with seller-scoped filtering
    - Settlements: `list`, `retry` with Privy authentication required
  - Created comprehensive RBAC test suite (`tests/admin_rbac.test.ts`) with 13 tests covering:
    - Authentication checks (401 without valid Privy token)
    - Authorization checks (403 for non-owners)
    - Happy paths for authorized sellers
  - All tests use proper Privy mocking with realistic response shapes
  - Full test suite: 49 tests passing, no regressions

- **Task 4 (Payment Links Admin & Idempotency):** Completed admin CRUD endpoints and dashboard UI.
  - Exported payment link CRUD helpers from `apps/lib/dbClient.ts`: `listPaymentLinksBySeller`, `getPaymentLinkById`, `updatePaymentLink`, `expirePaymentLink`.
  - Created three admin pages API endpoints: `GET /api/payment_links/list` (returns seller's links), `POST /api/payment_links/update` (update metadata/price/currency/expiry with ownership validation), `POST /api/payment_links/expire` (mark link as expired).
  - Added React component `PaymentLinksManager.tsx` for dashboard UI (list, inline edit, expire actions).
  - Created dashboard page `/payment_links` to mount manager component.
  - Implemented persistent idempotency via `idempotency_keys` table (migration 008) with dedup logic in public resolver.
  - Added comprehensive test suite (7 tests) validating Privy authentication, authorization (seller ownership), and CRUD operations.
  - All tests passing, no regressions (36 tests total).
- Added `payment_links` schema and DB helpers; implemented admin create API and public resolver (`GET` + `POST`) that creates `payment_attempts` for a token. Public client page `app/link/[token]/page.tsx` was added and wired to POST attempts.
- Implemented payouts/offramp end-to-end surface: migration, DB helpers, pages APIs, and a basic `PayoutsPanel` UI.
- Added dev-settle simulator and dev-only dashboard controls to simulate settlement flows without an external facilitator (gated by env flag).
- Standardized server-side admin/public APIs to Next.js pages routes to avoid import resolution fragility with app-router server helpers; removed conflicting app-router API routes where necessary.
- Implemented dual DB runtime paths (Supabase vs Postgres) across `apps/lib/dbClient.ts` and updated worker (`scripts/settlementWorker.js`) to support both. Worker currently posts to a configured `FACILITATOR_URL` and processes settle responses, confirming reservations and creating `sales` when successful.
- Added Privy server-side verification helper (`apps/lib/verifyPrivySession.ts`) and `requireSellerAuth` middleware for protecting admin APIs.

## Remaining gaps / risks (focused)

- Persistent idempotency for payment attempts: ✓ implemented via `idempotency_keys` table.
- RBAC / server-side Privy verification for admin APIs: ✓ implemented and tested.
- Reservation reaper: background job to release expired reservations — not finalized.
- Worker hardening: ensure safe claim semantics and idempotency when processing settlements (important for money-moving flows).
- CI packaging: `pnpm` ignored build-scripts warnings need triage (approve builds, pin, or vendor) to avoid CI flakes.

## Short roadmap (next priorities)

1) ✅ Payment Links admin & idempotency — **COMPLETED**.
   - Admin CRUD endpoints (list, update, expire) with seller ownership validation.
   - Dashboard UI component for managing links.
   - Persistent idempotency via `idempotency_keys` table.
   - Comprehensive test suite (7 tests) with Privy auth validation.

2) ✅ RBAC / Privy server-side gating — **COMPLETED**.
   - All seller-scoped admin endpoints protected with `requireSellerAuth`.
   - Authorization checks enforce seller ownership across all resources.
   - Comprehensive test suite (13 tests) validating auth and authorization.
   - Full system test suite: 49 tests passing, no regressions.

3) Worker & reaper hardening (next):
   - Ensure worker claims via UPDATE ... RETURNING or SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.
   - Add reservation reaper scheduling and tests.
   - Validate idempotent settlement processing.

4) UX polish & demos:
   - Dashboard list of links, QR generator endpoint, `app/pos/[token]` minimal POS page.
   - Use dev-settle for demo flows in dev.

5) CI & production readiness:
   - Resolve pnpm packaging issues, add gated integration tests for webhook->worker->confirm flows, and create a production checklist (monitoring/backups/KYC).

## Concrete next actions (what I'll do now / short term)

- **Next: Worker & reaper hardening (Task 8).** This is critical for safe money-moving flows. Focus on:
  1. Ensuring worker uses safe claim semantics (SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED vs simple UPDATE)
  2. Adding idempotent settlement processing (handle duplicate webhook deliveries gracefully)
  3. Finalizing the reservation reaper (background job to release expired reservations)
  4. Adding concurrency tests to validate race condition safety

Product vision note:
- xsynesis will aim for feature parity with a minimal Stripe Connect-like experience for merchants: admin link creation, managed onboarding, per-seller payout destinations, and anti-fraud/reconciliation tools. We'll phase in compliance (KYC) and provider integrations for fiat rails after an initial pilot on x402 rails.

## How to run locally (short)

1) Start a local Postgres (docker) with `.env.postgres` values and run migrations:

   set -a; source .env.postgres; set +a
   node scripts/run-migrations.js

2) Start Next dev server (bind to all interfaces):

   pnpm dev -- -H 0.0.0.0 -p 3000

3) Run unit tests:

   pnpm test

4) Gate integration worker tests with:

   export RUN_WORKER_INTEGRATION=true
   pnpm test -- -t 'worker processes a queued settlement (RUN_ONCE)'

Notes: make sure PRIVY_* envs are set when running RBAC-protected code locally.

## 12) Offramp: in-app payouts for sellers

Goal
- Let sellers withdraw or "offramp" their collected funds directly from the dashboard using configurable payout rails (on-chain withdrawal, bank/ACH via a payments provider, or stablecoin rails). The feature reduces friction for merchants and keeps the money flow inside the product experience.

Why this matters
- Merchants need a simple way to get funds from the system to a usable destination (their on-chain wallet, a bank account, or stablecoin custodial rails). Without an in-app offramp, sellers must manually reconcile and move funds off-platform.

Proposed MVP scope
- UI: simple Payouts page in the dashboard where a seller can:
  - See available balance (settled sales, pending holds)
  - Request a payout and choose a payout method (on-chain wallet address, bank transfer via provider, stablecoin withdrawal)
  - View payout history and status (requested, processing, completed, failed)
- Backend: payouts table + APIs to create/list payouts and to mark status updates (created, processing, completed, failed). Payments execution is delegated to a payments provider or on-chain router.
- Rails: support two immediate rails for MVP:
  1. On-chain—send funds to seller's configured wallet (for chain-native payouts). This can be implemented as a signed tx broadcast by a custody/key manager or by instructing the seller to pull funds to their own wallet (lighter MVP).
  2. Provider-mediated fiat payouts—integrate a payments provider (e.g., Stripe Connect, Plaid+Payrails, or a crypto custodian with bank rails) to handle bank transfers and compliance.

Data model (high level)
- `payouts` table: id, seller_id, amount_cents, currency, method (onchain|bank|stablecoin), destination (json), status, requested_at, processed_at, metadata
- Link `payouts` to `sales` or aggregate settled balances so finance reconciliation is straightforward.

Security & compliance
- KYC/AML: gate large payouts or fiat rails behind KYC/AML checks. Implement a KYC-required flag and block payouts until verification.
- Audit trail: store events and receipts for each payout; ensure idempotent processing (avoid double transfers).

Acceptance criteria (MVP)
- Sellers can request a payout from the dashboard and view its status.
- A `payouts` record is created and is visible in the admin dashboard.
- For on-chain payouts, a signed tx or transaction instruction is recorded in the `payouts` record (or a clear operator workflow exists to execute it).

Next steps / integration notes
- Add `db/migrations/00X_payouts.sql` to create the `payouts` table and a small admin API (`apps/dashboard/pages/api/payouts/*`) protected by `requireSellerAuth`.
- Implement a simple UI `apps/dashboard/pages/payouts.tsx` that lists available balance and allows a payout request.
- Initially implement on-chain payouts as a manual operator flow (record payout, mark processed). Then add automated execution once custody/integration is chosen.
- Add KYC gating and compliance checks before enabling fiat rails.

Related todo: I added "Offramp payouts UI & payout rails integration" to the production milestones todo list (see repo todo list).

## Prioritized next steps (concrete, actionable)
1. Implement dev-settle simulator (dev mode) — immediate demo value and useful to validate UI and confirm+sale path. (2–3 hours)
2. Implement `payment_links` + link resolver page + QR generator (short link & POS page). (1–2 days)
3. Small POS demo page that uses buyer SDK to sign and send an `X-PAYMENT` to the server or to broadcast a transaction. (1 day)
4. Implement server-side RBAC/Privy gating for admin routes. (1 day)
5. Add reservation reaper worker. (2–4 hours)
6. Add integration test for webhook -> worker -> sale (gated). (0.5–1 day)
7. Triage CI `pnpm` build-script warnings. (0.5–1 day)

If you want me to take a single next change now, I recommend #1 (dev-settle simulator) because it gives you an immediate way to demo the "instant settlement" claim without depending on an external facilitator. I can implement it gated by `DEV_SETTLE_ENABLED=true` and wire a tiny dev-only dashboard control.

## Tests & verification I’d add
- Unit test for the new dev route (happy-path success/failure).
- Mocked unit test proving the flow calls `confirmReservationAndCreateSale`.
- Add or enable an integration test (gated) to show worker processing a settlement creates a sale.

## Risks / production blockers to resolve before shipping
- RBAC/Privy for seller endpoints
- Reservation reaper (prevents stuck-reservations & inventory lock)
- CI package build-script issue (may break installs in CI)
- Supabase path is not strongly transactional; prefer Postgres for production

## Do you want me to implement something next?
Options:
- “Go: dev-settle” (I’ll add a dev-only settle endpoint + small dev dashboard button, tests, and run unit tests)
- “Go: short-link” (I’ll implement `payment_links` table + link resolver page + QR generator)
- “Docs only” (I’ll write the team-facing document synthesizing the above into docs or a single export `docs/x402_mapping.md`)

If you pick dev-settle, confirm whether the default behavior should:
A) Immediately call `confirmReservationAndCreateSale` for all reservations associated with the provided `payment_attempt_id` (fast demo), or
B) Insert a `settlements` row and let the worker process it (exercises worker path).

I'll implement and run unit tests and report back with PASS/FAIL, file changes, and how to try it locally.
